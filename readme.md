# TODO Improved

A little project that is in build process. It will have some original features, such as:

* Collaboration with others;
* Inviting;
* Account creation;
* OAuth.

Maybe it will take a time to be finished. But if it get completed, it will be deployed, for sure.

Maybe i'll change the repo's name too. Fluent-Online-Todo is not a good name, i think.
